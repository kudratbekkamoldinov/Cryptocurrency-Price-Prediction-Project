# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Crypto_predict.ipynb`, dedicated to predicting cryptocurrency prices using historical price data and machine learning models. The project aims to demonstrate the application of various data science techniques in the financial domain, specifically in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

## Project Overview

The `Crypto_predict.ipynb` notebook explores several key areas:

- **Data Collection**: How to gather cryptocurrency price data from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the data for analysis, including cleaning and normalization.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating features that can help in predicting cryptocurrency prices.
- **Model Building**: Developing machine learning models to predict future prices of cryptocurrencies.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
